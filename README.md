## Installation
<br>1. `npm i`<br>2. `mysql -uroot -p`<br>3. `SOURCE schema.sql`<br>4. `npm run seed`
        
## Usage
To create the sql data base using `mysql...` & `SOURCE schemal.sql`, open the integrated terminal in the `db` folder. Afterwards, open the integrated terminal in the main folder to run `npm run seed`, and finally, `node server.js` to start the application. NOTE: since this application isn't deployed the only way you can run it is by downloading it. To use sequelize, the application requires a DB_NAME, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_USER to be set in a `.env` file. Create one in main with the ecommerce_db, and your mysql user and password.
